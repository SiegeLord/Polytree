# Goal

Climb the branches to get away from the bottom of the screen before the time runs out! Suffer not the ROOT of all evil and escape the EVIL EMPEROR!

# Controls

* Left - Move left
* Right - Move right

# Compilation

You should be able to compile it by getting a nightly Rust, installing Allegro 5.1.x and then running `cargo run`.

# Rules

## Genre requirements

*Two button controls! Growing!*

The game is controlled by two buttons. The tree branches grows.

## Technical requirements

### Final Boss

*The game must have a final boss to defeat. This does not limit you into an adventure or action game! Even Tetris Attack featured "bosses" of sorts.*

There's a boss at every stage. I guess it's not completely final, but you're free to quit after you beat it :P.

### Just a minute

*The main gameplay must take exactly one minute to complete, whether the player(s) win or lose.*

Each stages takes 1 minute.

## Artistic requirements

### Brainwashing/Propaganda

*It doesn't matter what the idea is, but the program should stamp it in at every available moment, or let it sub-consciously sift into the user's mind. The more complicated idea the better. The more effective the better. Please make note of what you are trying to bring over, so it is verifiable.*

The enemies in this game are dollar signs, which reinforces the idea that money is the root of all evil. The boss resembles a logo of a certain Redmond company.

### Mutating visuals

*The game must continually change its visuals - distorting, changing colour, or changing the shape of playfield altogether - the more creative you get, the better.*

Every stage starts out with a different color. The branches also provide a dynamic playing field.

## Bonus rules

### Act of Politician

*Hide your incompetence! If one rule is too tough for you, omit it by putting in a distraction that kicks donkeys. F.i. if one rule says you must have a high score table, you should make the UI look like if there was one, but when game ends, interrupt everything with lots of eye candy and great music. Or with a neat bonus mini game.*

Unused.
